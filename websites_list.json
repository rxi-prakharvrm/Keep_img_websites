    "description": "This web application will help you to learn touch typing which means typing through muscle memory without using your eyesight to find the keys. It can improve your typing speed and accuracy dramatically. The opposite is hunt and peck typing, a method of typing in which you look at the keyboard instead of the screen, and use only the index fingers.",
